# BAMAZON

BAMAZON is an Amazon like storefront created with mySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## Technologies used:

1. Node.js
2. Javascript
3. MySQL workbench 

## npm packages: 

1. mySQL
2. inquirer


## How to use BAMAZON

1. Clone repo on your computer.
2. Install MySQL and inquirer packages
3. Insert your MySQL workbench password on line 15
4. Type in node bamazonCustomer.js and run the command to place your order


## Problems faced:

1. This looks nothing compared to how the demo showed in class. But I am glad that I got to show the products on my terminal.
2. Each time I would push my work to the repo, I would have to replace my password with "INSERT PASSWORD" and when I would go back on the terminal to run the file it would not work. It took me few minutes to figure out why that was happening.
